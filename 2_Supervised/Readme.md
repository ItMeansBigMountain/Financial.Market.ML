## TL;DRs for Each Notebook and the Bigger Picture

### 1-Data-Preprocessing.ipynb
#### TL;DR
- Focuses on preparing the raw data for machine learning. Cleans, transforms, and creates new features to improve the model's performance.

### 2-XG-Boost-Feature-Selection.ipynb
#### TL;DR
- Concentrates on selecting the most relevant features for the model. Uses XGBoost to identify which features contribute the most to the predictive power of the model.

### 3- XGBOOST-Binary-Classification-Model-Evaluation.ipynb
#### TL;DR
- Builds and evaluates a binary classification model using XGBoost. The notebook incorporates the preprocessed data and selected features to train, validate, and potentially deploy the model.

### Bigger Picture
#### TL;DR
- The three notebooks form a comprehensive machine learning pipeline. The first notebook preps the data, the second selects the best features, and the third builds and evaluates the model. This pipeline ensures efficient and effective model training, which is crucial for reliable predictions in real-world applications.
