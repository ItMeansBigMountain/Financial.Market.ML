| Term                        | Quick Explanation                                                                 |

| **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** | An advanced algorithm for reinforcement learning used to optimize policies. |
| **Policy Gradient Method**  | A method to optimize policies in reinforcement learning by using gradients.       |
| **Actor**                   | The neural network that decides what action to take based on the current state.   |
| **Critic**                  | The neural network that evaluates the action taken by the actor.                  |
| **State**                   | The current situation or observation from the environment (e.g., stock prices).   |
| **Action**                  | The decision made by the actor (e.g., buy, sell, hold).                           |
| **Environment**             | The system the agent interacts with (e.g., stock market simulation).              |
| **Reward**                  | Feedback received after taking an action (e.g., profit/loss from a trade).        |
| **Done**                    | Indicates whether the episode (e.g., trading period) is over.                     |
| **Value**                   | The expected return of a state as estimated by the critic.                        |
| **Action Probabilities**    | The likelihood of taking each possible action, provided by the actor.             |
| **Advantage**               | The measure of how much better an action is compared to the average action.       |
| **Weighted Probabilities**  | Probabilities adjusted by the advantage to calculate loss.                        |
| **Total Loss**              | Combined loss from both the actor and the critic used to update the networks.      |
| **Trajectory**              | The sequence of states and actions taken during an episode.                       |
| **Episode**                 | A full sequence of actions from the start to the end of the task.                 |
| **Batch**                   | A collection of data (states, actions, rewards, etc.) used to update the networks.|
| **Memory**                  | Storage of data collected during episodes to be used for learning.                |
| **On-Policy Method**        | The agent learns from actions taken under the current policy.                     |
| **Discount Factor (γ)**     | Reduces the value of future rewards to account for uncertainty.                   |
| **Softmax Activation**      | Converts output scores to probabilities in neural networks.                       |
| **Clipping**                | A technique to prevent large updates that could destabilize learning.             |

#### Quick Reference Guide

1. **PPO Basics**
   - **PPO**: Optimizes policies in RL using gradients.
   - **Actor**: Decides actions.
   - **Critic**: Evaluates actions.

2. **Process Flow**
   - **State**: Current observation (e.g., stock data).
   - **Action**: Decision (e.g., buy, sell).
   - **Environment**: System interacting with agent.
   - **Reward**: Feedback after action.
   - **Done**: Whether the episode is over.

3. **Learning and Optimization**
   - **Value**: Expected return of a state.
   - **Advantage**: How much better an action is.
   - **Total Loss**: Combined actor and critic loss.
   - **Memory**: Stores data for learning.

4. **Training and Updating**
   - **Trajectory**: Sequence of states and actions.
   - **Episode**: Full sequence of actions.
   - **Batch**: Data collection for updates.
   - **Discount Factor (γ)**: Future rewards discount.
   - **Softmax Activation**: Converts scores to probabilities.
   - **Clipping**: Prevents large, destabilizing updates.

### Example Workflow: PPO in Action

1. **Get Initial State**
   - From the environment (e.g., stock prices).

2. **Actor and Critic**
   - Actor decides action.
   - Critic evaluates action.

3. **Take Action**
   - Environment provides next state, reward, and done signal.

4. **Store Data**
   - Store state, action, reward, and done in memory.

5. **Update Networks**
   - Every few steps, calculate advantage and loss.
   - Use batches of data to update actor and critic.

6. **Repeat**
   - Continue until the episode ends.
   - Repeat for many episodes to train the model.
