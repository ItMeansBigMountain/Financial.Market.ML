## Input Layer

### Definition
The initial layer where the neural network begins its computations.

### Role
- Serves as nodes in the neural network
- Each node in this layer corresponds to a variable (feature) in your dataset.

### Importance
- Serves as the interface between the data and the network.
- The quality and quantity of features can directly impact the performance of the network.

## Weights

### Definition
Numerical coefficients that the network learns through training.

### Role
- Multiplies each input node in the formula `Input * weights[x]`.
- Weights are adjusted during the learning process.

### Importance
- Influences how much impact each feature will have on the output.
- Learning the optimal set of weights is one of the main goals during the training process.

## ReLu (Rectified Linear Unit)

### Definition
A popular activation function used in hidden layers.

### Role
- Triggered during forward propagation
- Transforms the weighted sum of its input into an output signal for the next layer.

### Importance
- Introduces non-linearity into the network.
- Helps the network learn complex patterns during training.

---

## BackPropagation

### Definition
The process of optimizing the weights of the network.

### Role
- It calculates the loss by comparing the predicted output with the actual output.
- The loss is then propagated back through the network to adjust the weights.

### Importance
- The core algorithm for training neural networks.
- Minimizes the error and makes the network smarter with each iteration.

### Mechanism
- Starts by taking the output from randomly generated weights and biases.
- Generates a binary prediction based on this output.
- The output is then cycled back to the input layer for weight adjustments.

---

## Epochs

### Definition
Each complete forward and backward pass of all training Node Layers.

### Role
- One epoch consists of multiple iterations of backpropagation.

### Importance
- Determines the number of times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset.

### Mechanism
- The model's weights are updated after each epoch.
- Multiple epochs are often needed to adequately train the model.
