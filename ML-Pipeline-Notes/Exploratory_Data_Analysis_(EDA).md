## Objective

The primary goal is to dig deep into the data to understand its structure, relationships, and patterns that could influence the prediction of major incidents.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Overview**: Quickly scan the data to understand its basic properties like mean, median, and standard deviation.
2. **Data Visualization**: Utilize various plotting methods to visualize distributions, correlations, and patterns in the data.
3. **Feature Analysis**: Identify the most important features that could influence the modelâ€™s prediction.
4. **Statistical Tests**: Conduct hypothesis testing to validate assumptions and relationships between variables.

## Types of Analysis

- **Univariate Analysis**: Analysis of a single variable to understand its distribution and characteristics.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Analysis involving two variables to discover relationships.
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Analysis involving more than two variables to understand complex relationships.

## Statistical Tests

- **T-tests**: Used to compare the means of different groups.
- **Chi-square tests**: Used for testing relationships between categorical variables.

## Code Snippets

### Data Visualization using Matplotlib

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Line plot
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```

### Statistical Tests using SciPy

```python
from scipy import stats

# T-test
t_stat, p_val = stats.ttest_ind(group1, group2)
```

## Tools and Technologies

- **Data Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn
- **Statistical Tests**: SciPy

## Challenges and Solutions

- **High Dimensionality**: Visualizing data with many dimensions can be challenging. Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA can be used.
- **Data Skewness**: Transformation methods can be used to handle skewed data.
