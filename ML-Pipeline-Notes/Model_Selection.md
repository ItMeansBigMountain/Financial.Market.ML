## Objective

To identify and select machine learning models that can effectively automate the technical analysis usually performed by an SRE.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Preliminary Research**: Understand the types of models that have been successfully applied to similar problems.
2. **Model Shortlisting**: Shortlist models based on the problem requirements and constraints.
3. **Initial Testing**: Run initial tests to evaluate the performance of shortlisted models.
4. **Parameter Tuning**: Fine-tune the parameters of the selected models for optimal performance.
5. **Final Selection**: Pick the model that performs best on the validation set.

## Types of Models

### Supervised Models

#### Examples

- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

#### Special Features
