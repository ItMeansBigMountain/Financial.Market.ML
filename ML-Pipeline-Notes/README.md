### Data Collection & Preparation

- **Features to Collect**
  - CPU usage
  - Memory usage
  - Disk I/O
  - Network latency
  - Error rates
  - Request latency

- **Labeling for Supervised Learning**
  - Label data points where user experience lagged for more than the SLO as '1' (incident) and others as '0' (no incident).

### Data Preprocessing

- **Scaling**
  - Normalize or standardize numerical features.
- **Imputation**
  - Fill missing values if any.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualize data to understand patterns and correlations.
- Use statistical tests to confirm hypotheses.

### Model Selection

- **Supervised Models**
  - Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM
- **Unsupervised Models**
  - K-means clustering, DBSCAN
- **Time Series Models**
  - ARIMA, LSTM
- **Hidden Markov Models**

### Model Training and Validation

- Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
- Use cross-validation for better generalization.

### Continuous Feedback Loop

- Implement model in a real-time monitoring system.
- Re-train model periodically with new data.

### Monitoring and Alerting

- Set up real-time alerts for predicted incidents.

### Evaluation Metrics

- F1-score, Precision, Recall for classification models.
- Silhouette score for clustering models.
